----Statement 1 ----
/* Chocolate bar has the form of a rectangle divided into n×m
portions. Chocolate bar can be split into two rectangular parts by breaking it along a selected straight line on its pattern. Determine whether it is possible to split it so that one of the parts will have exactly k squares.
The program reads three integers: n, m, and k. It should print YES or NO.*/
----Solution----
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
k = int(input())
if k < n * m and ((k % n == 0) or (k % m == 0)):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

----Statement 2 ----
/*Given two integers A and B. Print all numbers from A to B inclusively, in ascending order, if A < B, or in descending order, if A ≥ B.*/

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
if a>=b:
    for i in range(a,b-1,-1):
        print(i)
else:
    for i in range(a,b+1):
        print(i)

----Statement 3 ----
/*10 numbers are given in the input. Read them and print their sum. Use as few variables as you can.*/

s = 0
for _ in range(10):
    a=int(input())
    s += a
print (s)

----Statement 4 ----
/*N numbers are given in the input. Read them and print their sum.
The first line of input contains the integer N, which is the number of integers to follow. Each of the next N lines contains one integer. Print the sum of these N integers.*/

N=int(input())
s = 0
for _ in range(N):
    a=int(input())
    s += a
print (s)
