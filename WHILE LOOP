----Statement 1 ----

For a given integer N, print all the squares of integer numbers where the square is less than or equal to N, in ascending order.

n= int(input())
i=1

while i**2<=n:
    print (i**2)
    i+=1

----Statement 2 ----

Given an integer not less than 2. Print its smallest integer divisor greater than 1.

n=int(input())
i=2

if n==2:
    print (n)
elif n==3:
    print (n)
elif n>3 and n%i!=0:
    while n%i!=0:
        i+=1
        if i==n:
            print(i)
        else:
            while n%i==0:
                print (i)
                break
else:
    while n%i==0:
        print (i)
        break


----Statement 3 ----

For a given integer N, find the greatest integer x where 2x
 is less than or equal to N. Print the exponent value and the result of the expression 2x
.
Don't use the operation **.


n = int(input())
two_in_power = 2
power = 1
while two_in_power <= n:
    two_in_power *= 2
    power += 1
print(power - 1, two_in_power // 2)

----Statement 4 ----

As a future athlete you just started your practice for an upcoming event. Given that on the first day you run x miles, and by the event you must be able to run y miles.
Calculate the number of days required for you to finally reach the required distance for the event, if you increases your distance each day by 10% from the previous day.

Print one integer representing the number of days to reach the required distance.


x= int(input())
y=int(input())
i=1

while x<y:
    x *= 1.1
    i+=1
print (i)
