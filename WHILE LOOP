----Statement 4 ----

As a future athlete you just started your practice for an upcoming event. Given that on the first day you run x miles, and by the event you must be able to run y miles.
Calculate the number of days required for you to finally reach the required distance for the event, if you increases your distance each day by 10% from the previous day.

Print one integer representing the number of days to reach the required distance.

----Statement 5 ----

Given a sequence of non-negative integers, where each number is written in a separate line. Determine the length of the sequence, where the sequence ends when the integer is equal to 0. 
Print the length of the sequence (not counting the integer 0). 
The numbers following the number 0 should be omitted.

x=int(input())
i=1

while x!=0:
    x=int(input())
    i+=1
print (i-1)

----Statement 6 ----

Determine the sum of all elements in the sequence, ending with the number 0.

x=int(input())
i=x

while x!=0:
    x=int(input())
    i+=x
print (i)

----Statement 7 ----

Determine the average of all elements of the sequence ending with the number 0.

x=int(input())
i=x
y=0

while x!=0:
    x=int(input())
    i+=x
    y+=1
    average=i/y
print (average)

----Statement 8 ----

A sequence consists of integer numbers and ends with the number 0. Determine the largest element of the sequence.


maxNumber = 0

isZero = False

while isZero == False:
    number = int(input())
    if number == 0:
        isZero = True
    else:
        if number > maxNumber : 
            maxNumber = number

print(maxNumber)

----Statement 9 ----

A sequence consists of integer numbers and ends with the number 0. 
Determine the index of the largest element of the sequence. 
If the highest element is not unique, print the index of the first of them.

maxNumber = 0
index = 0
totalNumbers = 0
isZero = False

while isZero == False:
    totalNumbers +=1
    number = int(input())
    if number == 0:

i = 0

while n!=0:
    n_next=int(input())
    
    if n_next>n:
